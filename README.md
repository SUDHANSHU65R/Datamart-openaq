## Steps

### 1. Data Ingestion

Source Data: Access OpenAQ's 2017 historical air quality data stored in AWS S3 bucket.

AWS S3 Bucket: Store downloaded data in an AWS S3 bucket for processing.

### 2. Data Processing with PySpark on EMR Cluster

AWS EMR Cluster: Set up an AWS EMR cluster configured with PySpark.

PySpark Jobs:

Read Data: Read .csv.gz files for the year 2017 from the given S3 path.

Data Cleaning: Remove invalid measurements, handle missing values, and perform data type conversions.

Data Quality Checks: Identify and log bad data for reporting.

Data Interpolation: Fill in missing values using linear interpolation.

Transformation: Extract necessary fields and create additional columns.

### 3. Data Loading into Snowflake

AWS S3 Intermediate Storage: Store cleaned and transformed data back to S3 in Parquet format.

Snowflake Data Warehouse: Load data from S3 into Snowflake tables using external stages and the COPY INTO command.

### 4. Data Analytics

SQL Queries: Provided analytical SQL queries to support BA's requirements.

Data Access: Use Snowflake's interface or BI tools to run queries.

#### Key Configurations and Considerations

### Handling Partitioned Data:

The S3 folder structure implies that data is partitioned by locationid, year, and month.

PySpark can take advantage of this partitioning to optimize data reading and processing.

### Reading Nested Folder Structures:

When using wildcards (*) in the path, ensure that PySpark interprets the partitions correctly.

Partition columns can be automatically added to the DataFrame if the data is stored using Hive-style partitioning. If not, consider extracting partition information from file paths if necessary.

### CSV Parsing:

Verify the CSV file format, including delimiter (commonly ',', but sometimes may vary), quote character, and whether headers are included.

Handle any inconsistencies in the CSV files appropriately.

### Compression Handling:

Compressed CSV files are efficiently handled by Spark, but ensure that the cluster has sufficient resources to decompress and read the files.

### Data Types:

Confirm the data types of each column, especially if using inferSchema. It might be safer to define the schema manually to avoid incorrect type inference.

### Performance Optimization:

Repartition or coalesce DataFrames as needed to optimize parallel processing.

Use caching if certain DataFrames are reused multiple times in the processing.

### Error Handling:

Implement try-except blocks in PySpark code to handle exceptions and log errors.

Ensure that failed jobs can be retried without data duplication or loss.

### Security and Access:

For accessing the public OpenAQ S3 bucket, confirm whether anonymous access is allowed. If not, appropriate AWS credentials or roles must be configured.
